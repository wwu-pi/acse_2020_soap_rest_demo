# Example projects for SOAP and REST in Spring

This repository features two projects: `soap_rest_client_example` and `soap_rest_example`. 

`soap_rest_client_example` contains the two client-classes for SOAP and REST. 

`soap_rest_example` contains the 'RESTful' web service and the SOAP web service. 

It is a bad practice to include the .class-files. The overall target-folder has been included **only** for this demo so that the SOAP classes do not have to be generated to get started.
You should still try to automatically generate the classes yourself using the commands mentioned in the lecture. The generated sources themselves **should** be included.
